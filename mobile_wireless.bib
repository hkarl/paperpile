  abstract = "The demand for reliable and efficient Wide Area Networks (WANs)
              from business customers is continuously increasing. Companies and
              enterprises use WANs to exchange critical data between
              headquarters, far-off business branches and cloud data centers.
              Many WANs solutions have been proposed over the years, such as:
              leased lines, Frame Relay, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS),
              Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Each solution positions
              differently in the trade-off between reliability, Quality of
              Service (QoS) and cost. Today, the emerging technology for WAN is
              Software-Defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN) that introduces
              the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm into the
              enterprise-network market. SD-WAN can support differentiated
              services over public WAN by dynamically reconfiguring in
              real-time network devices at the edge of the network according to
              network measurements and service requirements. On the one hand,
              SD-WAN reduces the high costs of guaranteed QoS WAN solutions (as
              MPLS), without giving away reliability in practical scenarios. On
              the other, it brings numerous technical challenges, such as the
              implementation of Traffic Engineering (TE) methods. TE is
              critically important for enterprises not only to efficiently
              orchestrate network traffic among the edge devices, but also to
              keep their services always available. In this work, we develop
              different kind of TE algorithms with the aim of improving the
              performance of an SD-WAN based network in terms of service
              availability. We first evaluate the performance of baseline TE
              algorithms. Then, we implement different deep Reinforcement
              Learning (deep-RL) algorithms to overcome the limitations of the
              baseline approaches. Specifically, we implement three kinds of
              deep-RL algorithms, which are: policy gradient, TD- $\lambda$ and
              deep Q-learning. Results show that a deep-RL algorithm with a
              well-designed reward function is capable of increasing the
              overall network availability and guaranteeing network protection
              and restoration in SD-WAN.",

  abstract = "MU-MIMO and OFDMA are two key techniques in IEEE 802.11ax
              standard. Although these two techniques have been intensively
              studied in cellular networks, their joint optimization in Wi-Fi
              networks has been rarely explored as OFDMA was introduced to
              Wi-Fi networks for the first time in 802.11ax. The marriage of
              these two techniques in Wi-Fi networks creates both opportunities
              and challenges in the practical design of MAC-layer protocols and
              algorithms to optimize airtime overhead, spectral efficiency, and
              computational complexity. In this paper, we present DeepMux, a
              deep-learning-based MU-MIMO-OFDMA transmission scheme for
              802.11ax networks. DeepMux mainly comprises two components:
              deep-learning-based channel sounding (DLCS) and
              deep-learning-based resource allocation (DLRA), both of which
              reside in access points (APs) and impose no
              computational/communication burden on Wi-Fi clients. DLCS reduces
              the airtime overhead of 802.11 protocols by leveraging the deep
              neural networks (DNNs). It uses uplink channels to train the DNNs
              for downlink channels, making the training process easy to
              implement. DLRA employs a DNN to solve the mixed-integer resource
              allocation problem, enabling an AP to obtain a near-optimal
              solution in polynomial time. We have built a wireless testbed to
              examine the performance of DeepMux in real-world environments.
              Our experimental results show that DeepMux reduces the sounding
              overhead by 62.0\% 90.5\% and increases the network throughput by
              26.3\% 43.6\%.",

              multiple users simultaneously at the same time and frequency,

              crucial component of NOMA systems, successive interference

  abstract = "Lyapunov optimization is a powerful control technique that allows
              the stabilisation of real or virtual queues while optimizing a
              performance objective. The method has become popular due to the
              fact that it applies a greedy optimization that does not rely on
              any statistical knowledge of the underlying process. Moreover,
              the technique includes a parameter $V$ to control the stability
              vs utility trade-off, offering a theoretical bound on the
              performance. However, in its basic form, the optimization ensures
              that queues are only asymptotically stable, and there is no
              guarantee that queues will stay below a given threshold at all
              times. This can affect the applicability of this technique to
              many applications with queues with limited capacity or,

              between the relay and cell-center user is imperfect. Both the

              HD relaying NOMA system at low SNR, but the situation is exactly
              the opposite at high SNR; 2) the mutual interference can cause a
              larger performance gap than the self-interference at the relay;

  abstract = "Random access (RA) has recently been revisited and considered as
              a key technology for the medium access control layer of the
              Internet of Things applications. Compared to other RA protocols,
              slotted ALOHA (SA) has the advantages of low complexity and
              elimination of partially overlapping transmissions, reducing the
              number of collisions, however it may suffer from congestion as
              the traffic load and the number of devices increase. To this end,
              two RA protocols based on SA and uplink non-orthogonal multiple
              access are proposed and applied to wireless sensor networks and
              wireless powered sensor networks. More specifically, to reduce
              the number of collisions and increase the throughput of SA, while
              maintaining low complexity, two detection techniques are used to
              mitigate the interference, when two sources transmit information
              in the same time slot, namely successive interference
              cancellation (SIC) with optimal decoding order policy and joint
              decoding (JD). To evaluate the performance of the proposed
              protocols, the outage probability of SIC and JD is derived, which
              is used to express the average throughput attained by each
              protocol in closed-form. Finally, both the analytical results and
              the simulations verify that the proposed protocols substantially

              evolution of the new wireless technology, it is challenging to
              address the network service outage with traditional methods. In
              the long-term evolution (LTE) networks, a large number of base
              stations called eNodeBs are deployed to cover the entire service
              areas spanning various kinds of geographical regions. Each eNodeB
              generates a large number of key performance indicators (KPIs).
              Hundreds of thousands of eNodeBs are typically deployed to cover
              a nation-wide service area. Operators need to handle hundreds of
              millions of KPIs to cover the areas. It is impractical to handle
              manually such a huge amount of KPI data, and automation of data
              processing is therefore desired. To improve network operation
              efficiency, a suitable machine learning technique is used to
              learn and classify individual eNodeBs into different states based
              on multiple performance metrics during a specific time window.
              However, an issue with supervised learning requires a large

              is an essential tool for planning and designing a radio network.
              Given a geographic region, and associated power estimates linked
              to the transmitter placements, our objective is to develop
              machine learning models to predict the strength of the radio
              signals. BACKGROUND: The propagation model is often used to
              determine the optimal location of radio transmitters in order to
              optimize the power coverage in a geographic area of interest.
              However, it is often a costly operation to obtain the exact power
              measurements over a region for a given set of transmitter
              locations. Therefore, fast prediction methods are needed to
              estimate the power values given limited data. METHODOLOGY: We
              consider a dataset consisting of simulated power at each point in
              an environment for a given set of transmitter locations. We
              experiment with various machine learning models, namely,
              generalized linear models (GLMs), neural networks (NNs), and
              k-nearest neighbor (KNN), to estimate the power values for a
              given transmitter placement. We investigate various feature
              engineering approaches to enhance the predictive performance of
              the machine learning models. RESULTS: We observe that employed
              feature engineering methods such as polynomial degrees and
              transmitter to cluster distances significantly improve the
              prediction accuracy. In particular, GLM model performance notably
              improves thanks to these extracted features, where mean absolute
              error (MAE) is reduced around 77\% from 11.37 dB to 2.55 dB. We
              note that KNN with $k =$ 2 and DNN models perform better than NN
              and GLM. KNN has the best performance with an average MAE of
              0.65dB and also substantially faster to train than NN/DNN models.
              In addition, our analysis shows that, to train a well-performing
              machine learning model, it is sufficient to use a dataset
              consisting of measurements at a fraction of the potential
              transmitter locations in a given region. CONCLUSIONS: Machine
              learning methods are highly effective for the coverage prediction
              task. Using carefully engineered features, simple models such as
              GLMs and KNNs can be as effective as more complex ones,
              especially for small datasets.",

              control (MAC) protocol for very-high-speed wireless communication
              networks in the Terahertz (THz) band is presented. The protocol
              relies on a receiver-initiated handshake to guarantee
              synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Two scenarios
              are considered, namely, a macroscale scenario, where nodes
              utilize rotating directional antennas to periodically sweep the
              space while overcoming the distance problem at THz frequencies,
              and a nanoscale scenario, where nano-devices require energy
              harvesting systems to operate. Both scenarios are implemented on
              a centralized and an ad-hoc network architecture. A carrier-based
              physical layer is considered for the macro-scenario, whereas the
              physical layer for the nano-scenario is based on a
              femtosecond-long pulse-based modulation scheme with packet

              reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in wireless networks to
              create smart radio environments. In a smart radio environment,
              surfaces are capable of manipulating the propagation of incident
              electromagnetic waves in a programmable manner to actively alter
              the channel realization, which turns the wireless channel into a
              controllable system block that can be optimized to improve
              overall system performance. In this article, we provide a
              tutorial overview of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
              for wireless communications. We describe the working principles
              of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and elaborate on
              different candidate implementations using metasurfaces and
              reflectarrays. We discuss the channel models suitable for both
              implementations and examine the feasibility of obtaining accurate
              channel estimates. Furthermore, we discuss the aspects that

              multiple traffic streams to different destinations. Packets from
              each stream arrive to the base station according to a stochastic
              process and are enqueued in a separate (per stream) queue. The
              queueing discipline controls which packet within each queue is
              available for transmission. The base station decides, at every
              time t, which stream to serve to the corresponding destination.
              The goal of scheduling decisions is to keep the information at
              the destinations fresh. Information freshness is captured by the
              Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this paper, we derive a lower
              bound on the AoI performance achievable by any given network
              operating under any queueing discipline. Then, we consider three

              impact of the stochastic arrivals, queueing discipline and
              scheduling policy on AoI. We evaluate the AoI performance both
              analytically and using simulations. Numerical results show that

              metric to measure the timeliness of information updates in a
              network. We consider AoI minimization problem for a network with
              general interference constraints, and time varying channels. We
              propose two policies, namely, virtual-queue based policy and
              age-based policy when the channel state is available to the

               and leader election in the classical model of multi-hop radio
               networks with unknown topology and without collision detection
               mechanisms. It has been known for almost 20 years that in
               undirected networks with n nodes and diameter D, randomized
               broadcasting requires $\Omega$(D log n/D + log2 n) rounds,
               assuming that uninformed nodes are not allowed to communicate
               (until they are informed). Only very recently, Haeupler and Wajc
               (PODC'2016) showed that this bound can be improved for the model
               with spontaneous transmissions, providing an O(D log n log log
               n/log D + logO(1) n)-time broadcasting algorithm. In this
               article, we give a new and faster algorithm that completes
               broadcasting in O(D log n/log D + logO(1) n) time, succeeding
               with high probability. This yields the first optimal O(D)-time
               broadcasting algorithm whenever n is polynomial in
               D.Furthermore, our approach can be applied to design a new
               leader election algorithm that matches the performance of our
               broadcasting algorithm. Previously, all fast randomized leader
               election algorithms have used broadcasting as a subroutine and
               their complexity has been asymptotically strictly larger than
               the complexity of broadcasting. In particular, the fastest
               previously known randomized leader election algorithm of
               Ghaffari and Haeupler (SODA'2013) requires O(D log n/D min \{log
               log n, log n/D\} + logO(1) n)-time, succeeding with high
               probability. Our new algorithm again requires O(D log n/log D +

  abstract = "In this paper, we develop a knowledge-assisted deep reinforcement
              learning (DRL) algorithm to design wireless schedulers in the
              fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks with time-sensitive
              traffic. Since the scheduling policy is a deterministic mapping
              from channel and queue states to scheduling actions, it can be
              optimized by using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). We
              show that a straightforward implementation of DDPG converges
              slowly, has a poor quality-of-service (QoS) performance, and
              cannot be implemented in real-world 5G systems, which are
              non-stationary in general. To address these issues, we propose a
              theoretical DRL framework, where theoretical models from wireless
              communications are used to formulate a Markov decision process in
              DRL. To reduce the convergence time and improve the QoS of each
              user, we design a knowledge-assisted DDPG (K-DDPG) that exploits
              expert knowledge of the scheduler design problem, such as the
              knowledge of the QoS, the target scheduling policy, and the
              importance of each training sample, determined by the
              approximation error of the value function and the number of
              packet losses. Furthermore, we develop an architecture for online
              training and inference, where K-DDPG initializes the scheduler
              off-line and then fine-tunes the scheduler online to handle the
              mismatch between off-line simulations and non-stationary
              real-world systems. Simulation results show that our approach
              reduces the convergence time of DDPG significantly and achieves
              better QoS than existing schedulers (reducing 30\% 50\% packet
              losses). Experimental results show that with off-line
              initialization, our approach achieves better initial QoS than
              random initialization and the online fine-tuning converges in few
              minutes.",

              systems with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Information
              freshness is characterized by age of information (AoI), defined
              as the time elapsed since the generation of the last successfully
              received update. Conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
              systems, say time-division multiple access (TDMA) systems, lead
              to high average AoI when a large number of users take turns to
              transmit their latest samples to a common receiver over a
              wireless medium. In contrast to OMA, NOMA allows multiple users
              to transmit simultaneously. Although NOMA could lead to higher
              packet error rates (PER) due to the wireless interference among
              users, we show that higher PERs do not always lead to a higher
              average AoI. Specifically, our experiments on software-defined
              radio indicate that NOMA with conventional multiuser decoding
              (MUD) techniques leads to higher PERs but lower average AoI than
              OMA does in the high SNR regime. Furthermore, to improve the AoI
              performance in the medium SNR regime, we combine MUD with
              physical-layer network coding (PNC), a technique that turns
              wireless interference into useful network-coding information. PNC
              works well even when the SNRs of different NOMA users do not
              differ much. This article is the first attempt to apply PNC to
              information update systems. Experiments show that the combined
              use of PNC and MUD reduces the average AoI significantly in a
              practical network setting. Overall, PNC-enabled NOMA is a
              promising solution to information update systems.",

              most appropriate server in terms of the latency and energy
              consumption, among many available ones. The server selection
              problem is challenging due to the randomness of the environment

               of studies that claim the need for more aggressive channel
               access to enhance spatial reuse. Against those previous ideas,
               this paper presents a different perspective that existing Wi-Fi
               devices already have excessive transmission opportunities, even
               without protecting each other in certain scenarios. We shed
               light on an anomaly within actual carrier sensing (CS)
               behaviors, which makes some neighboring devices become blind to
               each other and transmit simultaneously, due to undetected
               preambles. Through experimental study and analysis, we reveal
               both sides of the anomaly heavily affecting the overall network
               performance. Based on the observations, we design REFRAIN, a
               standard-compliant PHY/MAC framework, which copes with and

               standardization of the next generation WiFi such as IEEE
               802.11ad and 802.11ay. Due to the stringent Quality of Service
               (QoS) requirement of those applications, 802.11ad/ay have
               introduced contention free channel access called Service Period,
               which provides dedicated channel access exclusively reserved for
               communication between a pair of nodes. One type of user traffic
               supported by IEEE 802.11ad is isochronous traffic, which is
               essentially periodic traffic that requires certain channel time
               to be allocated before its period ends. So, isochronous traffic
               needs guaranteed channel time allocation with stringent

              networks, the design trend is moving toward an aggregated
              network, where different access technologies share a common
              anchor point in the core. This enables further network
              optimization in addition to hybrid access; examples are

              every ten years or so. However, the time difference between the
              so-called ``G's'' is also decreasing. While fifth-generation (5G)
              systems are becoming a commercial reality, there is already
              significant interest in systems beyond 5G, which we refer to as
              the sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems. In contrast to the
              already published papers on the topic, we take a top-down
              approach to 6G. More precisely, we present a holistic discussion
              of 6G systems beginning with lifestyle and societal changes
              driving the need for next-generation networks. This is followed
              by a discussion into the technical requirements needed to enable
              6G applications, based on which we dissect key challenges and
              possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across
              all layers of the Open Systems Interconnection stack (i.e., from
              applications to the physical layer). Since many of the 6G
              applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude more
              spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 GHz and 1 THz
              becomes of paramount importance. As such, the 6G ecosystem will
              feature a diverse range of frequency bands, ranging from below 6
              GHz up to 1 THz. We comprehensively characterize the limitations
              that must be overcome to realize working systems in these bands
              and provide a unique perspective on the physical and higher layer
              challenges relating to the design of next-generation core
              networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel
              multiple-access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation,
              radio frequency transceiver design, and real-time signal
              processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes
              required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign
              or significant reduction of the transport architecture that
              serves as a major source of latency for time-sensitive
              applications. This is in sharp contrast to the present
              hierarchical network architectures that are not suitable to
              realize many of the anticipated 6G services. While evaluating the
              strengths and weaknesses of key candidate 6G technologies, we
              differentiate what may be practically achievable over the next
              decade, relative to what is possible in theory. Keeping this in
              mind, we present concrete research challenges for each of the
              discussed system aspects, providing inspiration for what follows.",

  abstract  = "With the high demand for wireless data traffic, WiFi networks
               have experienced very rapid growth, because they provide high
               throughput and are easy to deploy. Recently, Channel State
               Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for
               different sensing purposes. To get a better understanding of
               existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing
               trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal
               processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance
               results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing
               algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own
               advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi
               sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing
               applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and
               estimation, depending on whether the outputs are
               binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the
               development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will
               be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go
               beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The
               survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness
               and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of
               WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three
               future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer
               network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of
               different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing
               capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.",
